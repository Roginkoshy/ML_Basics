Here we used Wine.csv which has 14 columns and 178 rows ,we predict to which category does the Wine belong to by using two Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm with Logistic Regression:-

a)Principal Component Analysis 
b)Linear Discriminant Analysis

For KernelPCA we used Social_Networks_Ads.csv which contains 4 columns(User ID,Gender,Age,EstimatedSalary,Purchased) and 400 rows.We need to predict whether the product is purchased or not using Logistic Regression with KernelPCA
