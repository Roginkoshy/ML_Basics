In MR we use dummy variables say for column country california and new york ,we will use only one dummy variable as other is used in the constant part.(b0)

DUMMY VARIABLE TRAP - this say we cannot use all dummy variables in our equation because d1=1-d2 and hence they are highly correlated i.e they one can be predicted using other.

# Avoiding the Dummy Variable Trap,
X = X[:, 1:],though python libray takes care of it but sometimes we need to remove 1st column

P-Value- Small p-value makes you reject null hypothesis say we have 200 chocs in chocolate box that should contain 70% nuts ,we check whether they contain or not 70% nuts ,but we cannot open all as then what we will sell,hence we will use 30 sample from this population and then will check the statistics say we use mean which comes 68% checking p-value for this we come to know say it will 0.18 now using signicance alpha=0.05 i.e above which if p-value comes we will be sure that the other chocolates will contain 70% of nuts, hence we cannot reject this null hypothesis


Everything else is given in pdf  
To clear console use ctrl + l in spyder.
Here we wont be able to plot the graph as we have 4 Dependent variable(DV) and 1 Independent_variable which require 5dimensions to plot.
 
Backward Elimination
We add x0=1 column (adding column of ones )  in dataset and multiply it by b0 i.e. 
Remember we want to add column of ones at the beginning so we will take an array as column of ones and then we will add it to the X matrix.

Endogenous value changing,exogenous value not changing.
