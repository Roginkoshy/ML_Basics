This folder contains a file Ads_CTR_optimisation.csv which contains 10 columns and 10000 rows ,each row representing an instance in which a user clicked the ad,the column containing 1 represents the clicked advertisement version by a user for that row.Our aim is to find most likely which ad is being clicked by the user.

The problem statement is that the comapany cannot afford to advertise in 10 different versions ,hence we need to find most suitable advertisement version out of 10 which is making impact on users and thus it is being clicked so that the company will keep on having that advertisement version;stopping other 9.
