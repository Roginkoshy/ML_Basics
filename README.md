  Here We have two types of file:-
 
  
   
   1)Salary_Data-We have 2 columns here(YearsExperience,Salary) and 31 rows , We need to predict salary of the customer using Linear regression problem.

   Multiple Linear Regression
   
   3)Position_Salaries.csv-We have here 3 columns(Position,Level,Salary) and 10 rows .We need to predict Salaries of the employees using following algorithms:-
                 a)Support Vector Regression
                 b)Decision Tree Regression
                 c)RandomForest Regression
                 d)Polynomial regression
