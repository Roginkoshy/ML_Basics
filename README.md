# ML_Basics
<pre>
  This contains basic templates which I use for a Machine Learning Model along with examples
 
  Here We have three types of file:-
 
  1)Social_Networks_Ads.csv-We have 5 columns here(User ID,Gender,Age,EstimatedSalary,Purchased) and 401 rows , We need to predict whether the customer will purchase the product or not.I applied following classifiers(along with the confusion matrix)to this problem:-
                            a)Logistic Regression-[[65,  3],[ 8, 24]]
                            b)Decision Tree- [[62,  6],[ 3, 29]]
                            c)KNearestNeighbour- [[64,  4],[ 3, 29]]
                            d)KernelSVM- [[64,  4],[ 3, 29]}
                            e)NaiveBayesClassifier- [[65,  3],[ 7, 25]]
                            f)RandomForestClassifier- [[63,  5],[ 3, 29]]
                            g)SVM-[[66,  2],[ 8, 24]]
   
   2)Salary_Data-We have 2 columns here(YearsExperience,Salary) and 31 rows , We need to predict salary of the customer using Linear regression problem.
   
   3)50_Startups-We have here 5 columns(R&D Spend,Administration,Marketing Spend,State,Profit) , 51 rows and need to predict Profit for each startup using following regression models:-
                 a)Linear Regression
                 b)Decision Tree Regression
                 c)RandomForest Regression
                 d)Multiple Linear Regression
                 e)Polynomial regression
                 f)Support Vector Regression
